                    at different times, which is proved <br> by blogger Miranda Singhs, in the clip she <br> was with a pregnant belly, and in the <br> advertisement she is already holding on <br> to her baby.On the subject of advertising,the students
                    of the school again<br> share the most incredible rumors about Ariana and her new perfume.For <br> example,they say that she sings to her flower garden, swims with<br> mermaids in the Bermuda Triangle, uses only the juiciest raspberry
                    for
                    <br> perfume (so she needs to eat more of it to smell the same) and even <br> used a piece of her hair for her perfume. Singer fans are already <br> writing that it was probably one of the few commercials they didn't<br> want to go
                    through.

                    parents and<br> brother.However, the musician did not forget about his close friends whom he<br> bequeathed his clothes to, electronic items (TV, laptop, iPad), furniture, as well<br> as various musical instruments and jewelry.<br>                    Read more <a class="more" href="">here</a>
